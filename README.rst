===================
nethserver-ejabberd-next
===================

The chat function is implemented using ejabberd XMPP server. Enabled features are:

* LDAP based roster
* SSL/TLS
* Admin group

If you want to give admin permissions to an existing user, just add the user to the special group ``jabberadmins``.
The ``jabberadmins`` must be created manually.

If the system has a remote account provider also reconfigure the ejabberd service: ::

    sss_cache -g jabberadmins
    signal-event nethserver-ejabberd-next-save

When used with AD backend, following limitations apply:

* The shared roster doesn't support groups
* The shared roster displays the list of user names (not full names)

See also the Server Manager UI API documentation: https://github.com/NethServer/nethserver-ejabberd-next/blob/master/UI-API.md

Configuration
=============

Properties:

* *WebAdmin*: Enable ejabberd built-in web interface. Can be ``enabled`` or ``disabled``, default is ``disabled``
* *S2S*: Enable the server-to-server (S2S) for XMPP federation (Port number: 5269). Can be ``enabled``, default is ``disabled``
* *ModMamStatus*: The XEP-0313: Message Archive Management (mod_mam). Can be ``enabled``, default is ``disabled``
* *ModMamPurgeDBStatus*: Purge the Mnesia database of old messages of mod_mam
* *ModMamPurgeDBInterval*: Remove messages older than X days, default is ``30``
* *ShaperFast*: Download speed limit in bytes/second for admin users, default is ``1000000``
* *ShaperNormal*: Download speed limit in bytes/second for users, default is ``500000``
* *LdapTlsPortOverride*: The user roster LDAP client does not support STARTTLS. If the system account provider is configured with STARTTLS, configure the user roster LDAP client to use this TCP port number during connections instead (default is port 636).

When enabled, web-based administration interface listens on 5280 port.
You need a user inside jabberadmins group to login.

Default access to server ports is set to public on following ports: 5280, 5222, 5223.


The XMPP server can be accessed using BOSH protocol (https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html) at URL ``/http-bind``.

Example:

* server FQDN: mail.nethserver.org
* BOSH URL: https://mail.nethserver.org/http-bind
